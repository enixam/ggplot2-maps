One of the most slighted parts of making a ggplot2[@R-ggplot2] visualization is scaling, and its inverse, guiding. This is the case partly because in ggplot2 scales and guides are automatically generated, and generated pretty well. Perhaps frequentyly we work with `scale_color_` and `scale_fill_` to change palettes used, yet aside from that, we have few experience tweaking scales, adjusting breaks and labels, modifying axes and legends or so. The **scales**[@R-scales] provides a internal scaling infrastructure used by ggplot2, and a set of consistent tools to override the default breaks, labels, transformations and palettes.  

## Basics

```{r}
library(scales)
demo_continuous(c(0, 100), breaks = breaks_width(20))
```
